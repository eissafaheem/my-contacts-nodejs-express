# Node.js & Express Contact Manager Backend Learning Project
Welcome to my learning project focused on building a contact manager backend application using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT authentication. This repository showcases my journey of learning and implementing various concepts within the realm of backend development.

### Project Setup
Creating an Express server as the foundation of the application.
Configuring Thunder Client to test API endpoints efficiently.
Structuring the project for building a contact management app.
### Express Basics
Setting up Express routers to manage API routes effectively.
Implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for contacts.
Handling diverse HTTP methods within a single route.
Utilizing built-in middleware to process data from POST requests.
Managing errors effectively using throwing errors and error-handling middleware.
Incorporating async handlers to manage asynchronous operations within route handlers.
### MongoDB Integration
Setting up and establishing a connection between the Express application and a MongoDB database.
Defining Mongoose schemas to model contacts and users.
Performing CRUD operations on contacts using Mongoose methods.
### User Authentication
Creating dedicated routes and controllers for user registration and login.
Applying password hashing techniques to enhance security.
Generating JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for managing user sessions.
### Protecting Routes
Implementing JWT token verification middleware to secure routes.
Ensuring access control and protecting routes specific to users.
### Handling Relationships
Establishing relationships between user and contact schemas.
Developing routes and controllers to support user-specific contact operations
